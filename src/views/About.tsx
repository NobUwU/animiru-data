      <h1>What is Animiru Data?</h1>
      <p>Animiru Data is what data remains from Animiru's old database before it was sold. You can search through users and view what data remains of them.</p>
      <h1>Can I watch anime here?</h1>
      <p>No! This is only for sorting through old data.</p>
      <h1>My Discord profile data is outdated?</h1>
      <p>I don't care, data will most likely never be regenerated.</p>
      <h1>When will Animiru be done?</h1>
      <p>Don't ask me. I don't associate with them anymore.</p>
      <h1>Are you making a new site?</h1>
      <p>ðŸ˜Š Yes! You can join my <a href="https://discord.gg/44VSDyugSz" target='_blank'>Discord</a> for future updates on when I decide to start.</p>
